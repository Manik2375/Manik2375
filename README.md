# Hey you!

How's it going? I hope you're doing great! I'm Manik Kapoor, a web development enthusiast with an owl ðŸ¦‰ as my profile picture. One day, this owl might just escape reality altogether, but until thenâ€”let's chat while we're still here! 

About my projects, well most of them aren't revolutionary and are only meant for learning purposes.

I am currently learning and planning to make some projects using *Mongodb, Node.js* before moving to other stuff. 

About DSA, well I have mostly done that in *C*. (And btw, for some reason I like *C*'s pointer (>'-'<) ) 

Iff you ever felt like chatting, DM me in the discord ^-^ (I hope you do! ;P)
