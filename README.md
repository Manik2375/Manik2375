# Hey you!

How're you? I hope you're great. My name is Manik Kapoor, and I am a guy who likes doing Web Development and for some reason has owl ðŸ¦‰ profile picture.
One day this owl will escape the world altogether, but hey! let's chat while we're still here. 

About my projects, well most of them aren't unique and are only meant for learning purposes.

I am currently learning and planning to make some projects using *Mongodb, Node.js* before moving to other stuff. 

About DSA, well I have mostly done that in *C*. (Btw, for some reason I like *C*'s pointer (>'-'<) ) 

DM me in discord, if you ever felt like talking ^-^ (I hope you do ;P)
